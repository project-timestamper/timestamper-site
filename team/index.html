      <p>Hello -- I'm Arthur Edelstein, a software developer with a long-time interest in the transformative effects of computers and the internet on our society. How will human society, culture and knowledge evolve in the new age of AI? No doubt our world will be drastically changed, just as it has already been by the industrial revolution and the internet revolution.</p>
<p>More specifically, I hope to find ways to create or improve software in order to protect and expand human rights. Internationally-recognized rights that are heavily impacted by software include the right to privacy (Article 12 of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>), the rights of access to information and free expression (Article 19), the rights to assembly and assocation (Article 20), and the right of access to culture, the arts, and science (Article 27).</p>
<p>Defending that last right (access to culture, arts, and science) requires not only anti-censorship services like Sci-Hub and bittorrent, and preservation efforts such as archive.org. The age of generative AI will surely require that we build new tools and services that ensure that humanity can hold on to its cultural inheritance.</p>
<p>In Project Timestamper, we are trying to contribute to that effort by registering immutable timestamps of records of human creativity; we hope you will join us in making sure that humanity's authentic cultural and scientific heritage remain known to future generations.</p>

      <p>Hi, I’m Yağmur Şahin, the Co-Founder of Project Timestamper.</p>
<p>I am a Turkish-qualified lawyer with dual master’s degrees in cybersecurity, and I’ve been working in data protection for over five years.</p>
<p>I’m currently the Information Governance &amp; Data Protection Manager at Data Protection Simplified &amp; BJM Privacy, where we help organisations protect data, respect privacy, and stay compliant with regulations like GDPR. I also serve as Counsel at Kavlak Law Firm, advising businesses on Privacy by Design and data protection risk management frameworks.</p>
<p>In addition, I’m a Privacy Engineering Advisory Board Member at the IAPP.</p>
<p>At Project Timestamper, Arthur and I are focused on preserving truth and authenticity in the age of generative AI. With AI making it easier than ever to fake content, we use blockchain technology to build a framework for transparency and accountability, safeguarding history, culture, and intellectual heritage for future generations.</p>
<p>That’s why we timestamp information, enabling people to verify authenticity and integrity. In a world where misinformation spreads rapidly, having tools to validate what’s real is more important than ever. By locking in truth today, we ensure it stays reliable and protected for the future.</p>
<p>This is about trust—making sure what we know is authentic today stays authentic tomorrow.</p>
<p>Join us and help protect truth for the future.</p>
