Project Timestamper is an open-source effort to enable authentication of human-created culture and scientific works.

## Team

### Yağmur Şahin

Hi, I’m Yağmur Şahin, the Co-Founder of Project Timestamper.

I am a Turkish-qualified lawyer with dual master’s degrees in cybersecurity, and I’ve been working in data protection for over five years.

I’m currently the Information Governance & Data Protection Manager at Data Protection Simplified & BJM Privacy, where we help organisations protect data, respect privacy, and stay compliant with regulations like GDPR. I also serve as Counsel at Kavlak Law Firm, advising businesses on Privacy by Design and data protection risk management frameworks.

In addition, I’m a Privacy Engineering Advisory Board Member at the IAPP.

At Project Timestamper, Arthur and I are focused on preserving truth and authenticity in the age of generative AI. With AI making it easier than ever to fake content, we use blockchain technology to build a framework for transparency and accountability, safeguarding history, culture, and intellectual heritage for future generations.

That’s why we timestamp information, enabling people to verify authenticity and integrity. In a world where misinformation spreads rapidly, having tools to validate what’s real is more important than ever. By locking in truth today, we ensure it stays reliable and protected for the future.

This is about trust—making sure what we know is authentic today stays authentic tomorrow.

Join us and help protect truth for the future.

### Arthur Edelstein

I'm a programmer, interested in the transformative effects of computers and the internet on our society. How will human society, culture and knowledge evolve in the new age of AI? No doubt our world will be drastically changed, just as it has already been by the industrial revolution and the internet revolution.

A longtime interest for me is trying to find ways that software can be created to protect and expand human rights. Internationally-recognized rights that are directly impacted by software include the rights of access to information and free expression (Article 19), the right to privacy (Article 12), the rights to assembly and assocation (Article 20), and the right of access to culture, the arts, and science (Article 27).

To protect these rights online, we need software built for the purpose. Free expression and access to information require anti-censorship measures such as Tor, DNS over HTTPS, VPNs, and the decentralized web. The right to privacy can be protected by privacy-preserving consumer software such as privacy-preserving web browsers and operating systems. The right to assembly and association benefits from encrypted communications. Access to culture, arts, and science require not only anti-censorship services like Sci-Hub and bittorrent, and preservation efforts such as archive.org; in the age of generative AI we will likely requires new tools and services to preserve the authenticity of such information.

We hope to contribute to this last effort by registering immutable timestamps of records of human creativity; we hope you will join us in making sure that humanity's authentic cultural and scientific heritage remain known to future generations.
