We are thrilled to share our Good News in the world of music, musicology, musicianship, and music appreciation!

At Project Timestamper, we have just completed an effort to preserve the authenticity of human recorded music.

You might have seen the [recent news](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/23/pirate-group-annas-archive-says-it-has-scraped-86-million-songs-from-spotify/) that Anna’s Archive compiled a collection of tens of millions of recorded tracks, thereby preserving music of all kinds, recorded by humans, for future centuries.

This is a vital archive for preserving a key component of our culture. What is more important — emotionally, culturally, spiritually — than music? Nothing!

But we are now in the age of AI slop, and in the near future, AI will generate massive amounts of imitative or tweaked music that will be difficult for our children and grandchildren, or even future historians, to distinguish from real, original, Human Music. We feel that future humans must have a way to know the Songs Of Their Ancestors.

So our independent work at Project Timestamper has been to digitally timestamp these 86 million individual recorded tracks to anchor their authenticity, using pre-existing digests. We embedded these timestamps on the Bitcoin blockchain using the OpenTimestamps service. The timestamps provide permanent cryptographically verifiable proof that these music tracks existed at the end of 2025, before AI content has come to dominate.

We ourselves aren’t storing any content: we are focusing narrowly on archiving the timestamp proofs, just as we have done for millions of books, films, paintings, and research papers that exist today in digital form somewhere on the Internet.

So if you love music, or culture, or science and you want to help us with timestamping, please reach out!

I want to 'lectrify my soul \
'Cause everybody been making a shout \
So big and loud, been drownin' me out \
I want to sing that rock and roll
