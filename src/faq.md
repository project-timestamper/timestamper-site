#### Do you store the timestamped files?

No. In general, we rely on the actual files containing cultural or scientific content to be stored elsewhere. In our project, we retain only cryptographic digests of those files, and the timestamp proofs necessary to verify the claimed date at which a file existed.

#### How is this project related to the [Open Timestamps](opentimestamps.org) project?

We are running this project separately, but we rely on Open Timestamps code and calendar services to generate the timestamps. We are very grateful for the service they provide -- please [consider donating](https://opentimestamps.org/#calendars)!

#### How can I verify a particular timestamp?

We are working on providing a user-friendly interface for verifying timestamps from this project. Please stay tuned!

#### I know of a collection that should be timestamped. How do I get started?

Let's talk! Please contact us with one of the methods at the bottom of this page.
