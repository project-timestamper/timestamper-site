Hi, I’m Yağmur Şahin, the Co-Founder of Project Timestamper.

I am a Turkish-qualified lawyer with dual master’s degrees in cybersecurity, and I’ve been working in data protection for over five years.

I’m currently the Information Governance & Data Protection Manager at Data Protection Simplified & BJM Privacy, where we help organisations protect data, respect privacy, and stay compliant with regulations like GDPR. I also serve as Counsel at Kavlak Law Firm, advising businesses on Privacy by Design and data protection risk management frameworks.

In addition, I’m a Privacy Engineering Advisory Board Member at the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP).

At Project Timestamper, Arthur and I are focused on preserving truth and authenticity in the age of generative AI. With AI making it easier than ever to fake content, we use blockchain technology to build a framework for transparency and accountability, safeguarding history, culture, and intellectual heritage for future generations.

That’s why we timestamp information, enabling people to verify authenticity and integrity. In a world where misinformation spreads rapidly, having tools to validate what’s real is more important than ever. By locking in truth today, we ensure it stays reliable and protected for the future.

This is about trust—making sure what we know is authentic today stays authentic tomorrow.

Join us and help protect truth for the future.
